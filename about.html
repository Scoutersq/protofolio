  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <div class="about-section">
    
    <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Aditya Raj Prasad, and I’m a passionate and enthusiastic Web Developer from Dhanbad, India. Ever since I discovered how websites work behind the scenes, I’ve been fascinated by the endless possibilities of web development. This curiosity soon turned into a passion, and today, I’m on an exciting journey to become a skilled and creative full-stack developer.</p>

<p>My journey began with learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These three languages helped me understand how to build the structure, design, and interactivity of a website. As I kept practicing and building small projects, my interest in web development grew stronger. I started exploring modern tools and frameworks like React, which made it easier and more efficient to create powerful and user-friendly web applications.</p>

<p>Apart from frontend development, I also wanted to understand how things work on the server side — how data is managed, how websites stay connected, and how information is stored and retrieved. That’s when I decided to dive into backend development. Currently, I am learning backend technologies using JavaScript and Node.js, and it has been an amazing learning experience so far. It’s exciting to see how the frontend and backend come together to build a complete, fully functional website.</p>

<p>I believe that web development is not just about writing code — it’s about creating experiences that are helpful, meaningful, and accessible to people all over the world. I enjoy solving problems, facing new challenges, and continuously learning new skills to stay updated with the latest trends in web technology.</p>

<p>In the future, I aim to become a full-stack developer who can confidently build both the frontend and backend of web applications. I want to work on projects that not only improve my skills but also make a positive impact on people’s lives.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio! Feel free to check out my projects, read my blogs, or reach out to me through the contact page. I’m always open to collaborating, learning from others, and exploring new opportunities in the world of web development.</p>
